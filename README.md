The Pomodoro Technique is a time-management method designed to increase focus and productivity by breaking work into intervals. Created by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, the technique uses a timer to divide work sessions into 25-minute blocks called "pomodoros," followed by a 5-minute break. After four consecutive pomodoros, a longer break of 15â€“30 minutes is taken.

The method is simple but effective for maintaining concentration, as it minimizes distractions and reduces mental fatigue. Each interval is a chance to work intensively without interruption, knowing a break is coming soon. The technique can be adapted to longer or shorter work sessions based on personal preference, and it works well for various tasks, from studying to project work.

This Python code creates a Pomodoro timer app using Tkinter. It features a graphical interface with buttons to start and reset the timer and visual feedback with a "tomato" icon to mark work and break sessions. The timer operates on a cycle: 25 minutes of work, a 5-minute short break after each work session, and a 20-minute long break after four work sessions. As sessions progress, checkmarks appear to show completed work intervals. The program leverages Tkinter widgets (Label, Button, Canvas) to display time and session information dynamically.
